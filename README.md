# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository! 🎅🎁  
This is where I will be sharing my solutions for the daily coding puzzles in the **Advent of Code 2025** challenge.

## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event during the month of December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, which challenges participants to solve problems using their favorite programming languages. It's a great way to improve problem-solving skills and learn new techniques while having fun!

## My Goal 🎯
I am working through the puzzles in **Python**. This repo will serve as my personal progress tracker, and I'll keep updating it regularly.

## How to Run the Code 💻
To run any of the solutions locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lacabrol/Advent_of_Code_2025.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the day you want to test:
    ```bash
   cd Day1
    ```

3. Run the Python file:
    ```bash
   python3 AdventDay1.py
    ```
